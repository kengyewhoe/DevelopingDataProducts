## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
transmissionMPG <- aggregate(mpg~am+cyl,mtcars , FUN=mean)
transmissionMPG$am <- ifelse(transmissionMPG$am ==1, "Manual", "Auto")
colnames(transmissionMPG)[2]<- "Number of Cylinders"
colnames(transmissionMPG)[3]<- "Average MPG"
plot_ly(transmissionMPG, x = ~ `Number of Cylinders`, y = ~`Average MPG`,
        color = ~as.factor(am), 
        type = "bar", 
        mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Average MPG of cars based on mode of transmission")
